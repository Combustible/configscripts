Files in scripts/.vim may be plugins or scripts released by their respective owners.
Licenses for these files REMAIN THE SAME as what they are released as (probably GPL in most cases).
These are all open source files, but I'm not pretending that I wrote them and have the right to re-license them.

Everything else that I've contributed here is public domain. Do with it what you want, with the license below.
